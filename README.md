# CO₂ Emissions Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, largely driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane, and nitrous oxide. This project analyzes **global CO₂ and GHG emissions from 1850–present** to uncover historical patterns, identify key drivers of emissions, and provide insights for climate change mitigation strategies.  

The dataset from **Our World in Data (OWID)** provides information on emissions, energy use, population, GDP, and temperature change. By combining **quantitative and qualitative variables**, we aim to develop clear, data-driven visualizations that support **policy makers, corporate sustainability managers, and climate researchers** in decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Goal (SMART-Aligned)  
- **Specific**: Analyze global and sectoral CO₂/GHG emission trends by country, sector, and socioeconomic factors (population, GDP, energy use).  
- **Measurable**: Quantify emissions per capita, per GDP, and cumulative emissions over time.  
- **Achievable**: Use publicly accessible, comprehensive historical datasets (OWID).  
- **Relevant**: Inform climate policy, corporate sustainability strategies, and research.  
- **Time-bound**: Analyze data from **1850–2023** with projections to support near-future decision-making.

## 🔎 Research Questions  
1. How have global CO₂ and GHG emissions evolved over time, and which socioeconomic factors drive these trends?  
2. Which countries/regions contribute most to total and per capita emissions historically and in recent decades?  
3. How do different sectors (coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, land-use change) contribute to national and global emissions?  
4. What is the contribution of different GHGs (CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide) to global temperature changes?  
5. Which regions or sectors hold the **highest potential for emission reductions**?
